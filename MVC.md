# Intro to MVC
MVC is a design pattern or architecture which helps in developing the web application in a most efficient way when compared with the traditional ASP.NET Web Application.

MVC makes the design of the application into three layers namely Model, View, and Controller. Each of these components are built to handle different aspects of the application.

1. Model layer represent the objects in our Application. Model is also a class which has all the objects and its properties and methods defined in it.

2. View Layer has all the html controls which define the UI of the application.

3. Controller basically handles the request from user. It is the heart of the MVC application as everyone say. It is responsible to handle the request and return a response to user by loading appropriate View with data from Model.

Using MVC, once the application is developed, we can use the same logic for either asp.net MVC Application or phone app just by changing the View Layer of the application. So MVC also enhances reusability.
