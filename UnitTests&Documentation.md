# Unit Tests & Documentation
Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of your code. In C#, unit is similar to a method. You thus write a unit test by writing something that tests a method.

## Unit Testing Best Practices
1. Arrange, Act, Assert
2. One Assert Per Test Method
3. Avoid Test Interdependence
4. Keep It Short, Sweet, and Visible
5. Recognize Test Setup Pain as a Smell
6. Add Them to the Build

# Where does the term "README" come from?
The nomenclature dates back to at least the 1970s and the PDP-10, though it may even harken back to the days of informative paper notes placed atop stacks of punchcards, "READ ME!" scrawled on them, describing their use.
## Readme Best Practices
1. Use template
2. Fill with your own text
3. After you've filled your README.md file with your own project's text, you should push it to your GitHub project
